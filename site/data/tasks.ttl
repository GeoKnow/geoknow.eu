Scalability, extensibility and flexibility shall be achieved by employing Service Oriented Knowledge Utilities (SOKU)1 in order to develop next generation GKS.2 Components of the system will be building blocks developed in individual work packages WP2-4, such as the semantics based geo-spatial information management subsystem (WP2), spatial knowledge fusing and integration methods (WP3), the development of user interfaces for spatial-semantic browsing and authoring (WP4). The developed components will be integrated within this task. While the common technical requirements will be one major input for the system design, other major sources will be the developed use cases and end user requirements as well as interoperability standards.
The system design defines clear interfaces between the individual components. It will be based on existing standards and will provide a modular plug’n’serve structure and shall be able to accommodate REST components and JavaScript user interface widgets. The architecture will be centred around the OWL/RDF-statement paradigm, which enables interactions between components on different conceptual levels, such as triples, classes and instances, ontologies, logical axioms etc."""@en ;

While it helps new contributors to guide with suggestions for categories to be instantiated on a map more experienced users will want to add new categories at their wish. 
In this task we aim at consolidating the type of information entered in volunteered geographic knowledge bases not by restricting the set of categories but rather:
develop algorithms semantically consolidating the meaning of categories. We aim at developing algorithms automatically mapping newly added categories to existing categories. The user has then the choice to reuse an existing definition of a well described and frequently used category or begin to define a new category. Newly added categories will be grouped with other categories into higher types of categories.

A slippy map, which allows users to zoom-to and select a certain geographical area. The slippy map will be based on existing Web map implementations, such as for example OpenLayers1 from Open Source Geospatial Foundation. The implementation will be extended to allow an overlaying of the displayed raster maps with additional information represented in vector formats, such as various types of markers, polygons and curves. 
A facet filtering component, which displays (a hierarchy of) semantic facets detected in conjunction with the selected map area. Only facets, which have respective adhering objects in the selected area as well as the overall number of objects adhering to each facet in the selected area will be displayed. Depending on the facet type, different selection widgets will allow to specify eligible facet-constraints, e.g date and number ranges and enumeration of facet values.
A result view, which lists in addition to markers and regions on the map the retrieved objects adhering to the selected facets. For each individual object in the result set, its properties can be displayed in a configurable way. It will be possible to define templates for the visual presentation of certain spatial objects, e.g. train stations, cities, parks etc. Based on existing vocabularies such templates will display semantic information in a customizable and domain specific way. 
The components’ usability will be evaluated in the context of their integration into the portals of the project partners, as described in WP5 and WP6. For this reason, we do not plan to evaluate the usability of the widgets “on their own”, as this will be covered by the respective reports.

The end users involved in the project (Unister, BROX) will heavily contribute to this task, as well as all other project partners. Further, current user communities (both end users and technology users) of Schnellecke, OpenStreetMap and geodata.gov.gr will be involved. Combined, these platforms provide access to millions of users with diverse (a) expertise (e.g. researchers, students. SMEs, citizens), (b) thematic areas (e.g. natural sciences, transport, statistics), and technology needs (e.g. data consumers, web services integration).
User requirements will be collected through a combination of appropriate instruments: (a) one-to one interviews with prominent users (10-15 users), (b) group meetings with expert users (10-15), (c) invitational online questionnaires for specific non-overlapping thematic areas and high technical expertise (30-60 users), (d) mass online questionnaires (100-200 users).

      rdfs:comment """The first focus of WP7 is the dissemination of the project results supported by community building and cross-fertilisation activities.
Both the industrial and the academic partners will play active roles in dissemination. For the use case partners, the case studies will form a key part of the dissemination activity. For the academic partners, consultancy to business and contractual research and development will be a significant part of dissemination, besides the normal channels of publications, conference papers, workshop organisation, and educational courses at university sites.
The dissemination programme foresees a multi-channel dissemination approach. First, the project outcomes will be disseminated by use of publicly available channels – such as workshop, conference, magazine, and journal publications. These will be aimed at sharing the results of the project with the scientific community, particularly the European, but also the international scientific community, to encourage their incorporation into the work of other scientists and technologists. Complementing this, there will be a programme of papers and articles in IT, Web Technologies and general business publications, and presentations at geo data, library, IT and business expos and conferences (e.g. LinkedDataPlanet, KM Europe, Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), Digital Curation Conference, CeBIT or Systems for telecommunication and IT) particularly targeted at the European Union and associated countries. We envisage that the innovative technology required for building spatial Linked Data applications, and the resulting open GeoKnow Generator, will be of great interest to both SMEs and large businesses alike.
We will put a special focus on demonstration activities in different forms of the possibilities that the newly developed technologies will offer. Target audience will be relevant industry and research actors whose main focus is the development of data and knowledge management systems, new scalable collaboration paradigms and their combination with information retrieval. The participation of globally acting partners (Ontos, OpenLink, BROX) will provide an additional, global dimension to our dissemination programme, in particular with Unister and Openlink as a globally acting E-Commerce and software vendor with offices in the US, and major European countries. Taking advantage of its worldwide unique information infrastructure, with products for enterprise information management, Unister can provide current research and technological solutions developed by the GeoKnow partners an ideal environment for demonstrating their real added value. The GeoKnow consortium will organize two end-user and industry days, one for each of the two case study applications corporate spatial business intelligence and e-science.
The project will set up and maintain an external Web site, which will function as a project dissemination tool, as a training portal and as a server demonstrating some of the project results. The Web site will itself be based on a Semantic Wiki system, so that project participants and interested users can register and be notified when new deliverables or software become available. Within the limitations imposed by appropriate protection of intellectual property, all major scientific results of this project will be made available to the research community, whilst the GeoKnow and components will be published as open source to facilitate take-up. Outcomes will be made available in a non-proprietary format. All open source components published will be extensively documented by means of textual documents and screencasts of professional quality illustrating how to download, install and operate the components in question. Documentation manuals and screencasts will be specifically identified as project deliverables and prominently published on the project's web site. The project will exploit modern, social-networking dissemination channels such as Weblogs, Newsfeeds (RSS), organize GeoKnow groups in social networks such as LinkedIn, XING, Facebook, Twine. The project will register its web site under the .eu domain for at least 2 years after the natural contractual end of the project and commit to keeping the web site alive for that period of time. It will link to other relevant EC and EC sponsored sites. 
The project will also deliver one or more web-based showcases and grant the EC the right to use the showcase(s) for its own dissemination and awareness activities. After the completion of the project. The Showcase(s) will feature a meaningful subset (software, data, etc.) of the functionality characterising the project demonstrator(s) arrived at, along with relevant copyright notices and contact information, and suitable installation aids and run-time interfaces.
GeoKnow will create a Researcher Early Access Group that will be open to participation to scientists working in related fields. Members of this group will get early access to project infrastructure and will be invited to experiment with GeoKnow components. This will both verify the generality of the plug-in interfaces and encourage take-up of the project results. The scientific communities that will be targeted by our inter-disciplinary community building efforts are very diverse and hitherto largely independent of each other: Geodata Management, Semantic Web and knowledge technologies, machine learning, e-science, and Big Data Management. 
In the first month of the project, the GeoKnow consortium will create a fact sheet suitable for Web publishing. The Fact Sheet will outline the project's rationale and objectives, specify its technical baseline and intended target groups and application domains, and detail intermediate and final outputs. The facts-sheet will be maintained and updated until the end of the project; this will be documented in the regular dissemination reports. It will be published on the website and related EC sponsored websites controlled by the consortium. Related to the fact sheet, the consortium will issue press releases within one month of the start of the project (prepared by InfAI and Ontos, translation and dissemination by all partners). The press releases will target the local or national press of all partners. The press release will describe the goals of the project in simple, jargon free language and whenever possible highlight the benefits to the region/country and the importance of the local partner being part of a EU consortium. A PDF version of the collection of such press releases will be listed as part of Deliverable D7.1.1. 
If suitable, the consortium may commit to radio and TV appearances. If this is feasible audio/video clips will also be submitted as additional deliverables.
Additionally, we plan to promote cross-fertilisation through inter-disciplinary workshops, organized alongside major conferences in the respective research fields. The GeoKnow partners representing each of these diverse research areas will be responsible to promote the project results within the respective communities. The project partners undertake – when invited – to contribute to and participate in focused concertation actions, themed seminars or special interest groups."""@en ;

These data structures can then be used by applications to run enhanced queries focussing on topics and customer motives on the integrated GKS data. Motive and topic based search is a new search paradigm, combining elements of information retrieval and questions answering. Such searches are particularly important in the e-Commerce domain, where customers search for parameters of products and services. An example of a motive and topic based search is “winter holiday with culture and mountains”, which could return travel options offering hiking as well as cultural highlights during the winter school holidays in the region of the searcher. Such searches require substantial (spatial) background knowledge as it can be only provided by the Web of Data.
The current state of the art is focused on querying data statically. Only by using the Linked Data paradigm it is possible to derive data from the Data graph dynamically. However, this approach would cause a large effort if the data is not organized well (state explosion during derivation).

      rdfs:comment """One goal of this task is to develop algorithms and services to map spatial (datasets with geometric information) and non-spatial RDF data. For example, often datasets only contain implicit geographic references, such as city names. However, this information alone is not sufficient for unambiguously identifying geographic entities.A further goal is therefore to provide a tool assisted way of providing context information and parameterizing transformations for the generation of high quality RDF datasets. The following components will be developed:
a component to lift implicit geographical references in data sets. Given an RDF data set with implicit geographical references, the module will automatically detect potential types of geospatial information and the relations to existing vocabularies. For instance, a dataset containing address information could be automatically geocoded using a service such as Nominatim. The address information itself can be identified either by the used vocabulary or by crosschecking the used values against reference lists of e.g. country, city and street names. Additionally, this enables interlinking with spatial datasets, such as GeoNames, DBpedia or LinkedGeoData. The component will be manually evaluated (a) using information retrieval measures, such as precision and recall, and (b) by comparison with reference datasets. For large datasets, sampling methods will be applied. 
a component to configure transformation of data in conventional formats into RDF using existing vocabularies. Based on the detected implicit information,the user will be able to specify the type, format, granularity and amount of data being transformed. 
a distributed system for continuously processing a large amount of conventional data into an RDF representation based on the configuration. The challenge here is the expected amount of data to be processed. Since the original data sets remain unchanged and evolve over time it is required to be able to quickly re-process large amount of RDF data. This component will be evaluated for its performance, such as by measuring the process time for different datasets and dataset sizes."""@en ;

In particular, the benchmark will be based on OSM and Natural Earth datasets, complemented by synthetic social data from the LOD2 Social Intelligence Benchmark. Further, to perform benchmarking tests that can deal with very large datasets, we will develop a suitable infrastructure by (1) evaluating existing high-performant and compact GIS storage formats for adoption of best practices (e.g. Oracle Spatial, PostGIS), (2) developing a suitable process for extract-transform-load of geo data, including coordinate transforms and schema mapping (e.g. GDAL/OGR, GeoKettle). This is in itself a matter of benchmarking but also enables running benchmarks targeting diverse geospatial workloads such as localized, potentially high frequency accesses for route planning and querying; as well as aggregation queries that span large portions of the map and join with thematic data.

The Sequoia workload is an initial checklist item for validating functionality and relative performance as opposed to existing GIS. Geoknow will move beyond the state of the art by using and further refining the geospatial benchmark built in LOD2, emulating heavy drill-down style online access patterns and accessing large volumes of thematic data. An example of this is zooming on a map shaded according to population density or real estate prices. Beyond this, benchmarking will look at more complex analytics such as deciding locations of services based on population distribution, competitive services, road network capacity and the like. The last category is not expressible as a query but requires database resident application logic.

Further, to compare GKS and its components with other state of the art systems, we will use the SEALS project benchmarking services. This will provide us with an objective evaluation of the GKS and its components.

Benchmarks will be done early, so as to provide constant tracking of performance.
Virtuoso's relational GIS functionality will be compared to PostGIS using the full scale OSM data and typical OSM queries and updates.
